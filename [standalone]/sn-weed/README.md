# Weed system explanation:

Read this carefully before opening a ticket.

**DUE TO STUPID INVENTORY SYSTEM, MOST ITEMS (`packedbuds` and `weedbaggie`) MUST BE SEPERATED INTO DIFFERENT SLOTS** like this: https://i.imgur.com/U2FnZoP.jpeg
(we will make a good inventory resource very soon)

## **If you cant see the plant while planting, switch to closer POV, first person helps the most **

## Growing

- Use `femaleseed` to plant, add `maleseed` on top for seed yields, if not, **default** females will yield buds.
- `Fertilizer` process will be needed for "Unknown" seeds. Talk to the boss if you forget your strains recipes.
- Water your plants! If not, they die and disappear. If fully watered, plants yields more products.
- More later...

## Drying

- `wetbuds` can **ONLY** dry in stashes.
- `drybuds` needs to be packed into `packedbuds`.

## Packing

- Go to boss location with atleast 5 `packedbuds`
- Make sure you collect your package after. Other people can collect it as well.
- `weedpackage` could be either bagged to corner, or do a weed run.

## Cornering

- **CORNERING IMPROVES YOUR STRAIN REPUTATION**
- 1 rep per baggie sold
- _More rep = more money_

## Renaming strains

- Once your strain reached `Config.RepName = 40000`, you can start custom strain name.
- **This will NOT take effect immediately in your inventory, you need to grow the plants after to get the new strain name.**

## Weed runs

- _More rep = more money_
- This **DO NOT** improve strain rep.
